# How to record transactions

## Getting Verified

In order to begin submitting transactions to the bot you must verify your RSN. `.pct verifyhelp` also shows this information.

To verify you must use `.pct verify <screenshot> <RSN>`

The verification screenshot must:

* Show the in-game chatbox with your Runescape screen-name clearly visible.
* Include a public chat message asking for verification and today's date.
* The RSN in the screenshot must match the one provided when applying.
* You may use a number of image hosts to upload your screenshot to including `gyazo` `imgur` or even `discord`

This is an example of an acceptable screenshot:

The example command for verification using this screenshot would be: `.pct verify https://i.imgur.com/XdspFz3.png suity`
